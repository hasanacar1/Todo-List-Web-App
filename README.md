# Todo-List-Web-App
 Todo List Application with flask and API Designing
Installation :

- Follow the installation steps

Explanations :
- The web app was created using the Flask microframework. The interface can be examined with the executable file obtained after installation.
SQLite, which has a built-in module in python, was used as a database.
- The functional requirements specified in the task have been fully implemented and these functions have been designed to return a response to the rest api requests.
- As a response to postman requests, api requests returned data in json format.
- Also created api_test.py file in addition to postman. Valid api requests and responses can also be checked there.There is also a page in the web interface that contains information about requests.
- You can find the python and html codes in the project under the "Source Codes" folder.

Development recommendations :
- Items in the Todo list can be divided into sub-items, and progress can be displayed as a percentage for each item.
- Swagger can be used for api design to provide visual documentation.
